# Corpus Latinum Lucae

This will be tools to create a searchable Latin Corpus built from texts from [theLatinLibrary.com](http://thelatinlibrary.com/).

Right now, I've finished a part-of-speech tagger that uses [Whitacker's Words](https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words) to tag text documents.

## Next on the list:

+ system for generating the tagged corpus
+ way to search the corpus
